# FOX CSS

A light Sass/CSS framework, built with the following things in mind:

* "mobile first" approach
* support for IE9+
* HTML5 ready
* modular template
* light resets
* inconsistency bugs fixes
* efficient grid system

The framework is very modular and can easily be customized according to specific needs. Please note that the whole code is commented in the Sass partials files, just open them with your favorite text editor.

    <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="path/to/fox.min.css" />

## Sass version

Sass version of FOX CSS is composed of one main SCSS file and several partial files:

* _variables.scss
* _mixins.scss
* _resets.scss
* _normalize.scss
* _utils.scss
* _grid.scss
* _grid-ie9.scss

You can easily edit and remove the partials you don't need, except for `variables` and `mixins`.
